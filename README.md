Slash Run is a very basic CLI version of the game Alto's adventure. The character, Slash('/') skis down a mountain and has to avoid falling into chasms.
Being a really adventurous character, he's ready to break his neck as he jumps and performs somersaults in the perilous landscape (very "appropriately"
presented using underscores and empty strings!) So play along and try setting up new records for Slash. 

Gameplay :

i) Press enter once to jump!

ii) Press enter multiple times to backflip.(8 times for a complete backflip)


Scoring : 

i) Distance : 5 X (The distance covered by Slash)

ii) Backflips : More the number of backflips performed by you, more your score.
  For successive backflips, score increases exponentially!


Game Over :

i) If Slash falls into a chasm.

ii) If he lands on his head or lands flat while performing a flip. (Remember Slash is a very symmetrical character, so often it's difficult to distinguish 
between his head and feet while performing a somersault. Why I didn't do anything inspite of knowing this is a problem? 'Cause I don't want you people to 
cross my High score!!)


Further Developments :

i) I wanted to introduce a way to control the difficulty of the game(to be read as 'speed'!) It can be done by using a user inputted variable in the 
time.sleep line of the program. For now you may vary the speed by manually changing the argument! See how fast Slash can run!!

ii) A text file can be maintained which would store data about the high score, maximum no. of flips, maximum distance covered, maximum successive backflips 
etc. and would display the data on the screen at the end of the game if any of these records are broken.
